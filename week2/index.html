        <h1>Notes:</h1>
        <p> This week was a recap on arrays, methods, and functions. 
          I found arrow functions exciting and spent some time learning how they work. 
          I found out arrow functions are designed to make your code 
          less messy by reducing the amount of typing you need to do.
          The dry method seems to fit well with the arrow function. 
          They also offer a way to write and read code to understand easily.
          I also watched videos and tried out external questions to help me 
          fully understand functions.

            I read callbacks are most valuable when one function needs to wait for another function to finish.
            Like waiting for a database to return a value. Would this apply to uploading a file?
