          <!-- Note here-->
          <b>The Constraint Validation API:</b> The constraint validation API lets you check inputs in a form for validity, and report back to the user if there's something wrong. An invalid form could be submitted by the user, but it would cause a validation error on the server when data is accepted from said user.
          <br><br>
          <b>Fetch API:</b> The fetch API is a JavaScript API that allows you to make HTTP requests. It's a way to make requests to a server, and get back a response.
          <br><br>
          <b>Supplying request options</b> The fetch API supports supplying request options. These options are passed in as an object, and can include the following properties: <br> <br> 
            <b>method:</b> The HTTP method to use for the request. Defaults to "GET". <br> <br>
            <b>headers:</b> An object of HTTP headers to send along with the request. <br> <br>
            <b>body:</b> The body of the request. This is used for POST and PUT requests. <br> <br>
            <b>mode:</b> The mode of the request. This is used to determine the nature of the request (for example, whether the request should use CORS, or whether it should be sent with credentials). Defaults to "cors". <br> <br>
            <b>credentials:</b> The credentials of the request. This is used to determine whether the request should be sent with credentials. Defaults to "omit". <br> <br>
          <br><br>
          <b>Uploading JSON data:</b> The fetch API supports uploading JSON data. This is done by supplying a body to the request, and setting the "Content-Type" header to "application/json".
          <br><br>
          <b>Uploading a file:</b> Files are uploaded using an HTML input type="file" element, FormData() and the fetch API. 
          <br><br>
          <b>Headers</b> The fetch API supports supplying request headers. These headers are passed in as an object.
