          <!-- Note here-->
          <b>Transform:</b> The CSS3 Transforms Module allows you to translate, rotate, scale and skew an HTML element. 
          Transform allows you to change how an element moves or looks, like making it smaller or larger.
          It is a set of properties that link together the visual and motion representation of the element.
          And it gives your animated elements three dimensional directions.
          <br><br>
          <b>Rotate:</b> The CSS3 Rotate Module allows you to rotate an HTML element. With CSS3 Rotate, you can rotate an element in any direction. 2D and 3D.
          <br><br>
          <b>Scale:</b> The CSS3 Scale Module allows you to scale an HTML element. With CSS3 Scale, you can make an element larger or smaller.
          <br><br>
          <b>Translate:</b> The CSS3 Translate Module allows you to translate an HTML element. With CSS3 Translate, you can move an element in any direction.
          <br><br>
          <b>Skew:</b> The CSS3 Skew Module allows you to skew an HTML element. With CSS3 Skew, you can change the direction in degrees of an element.
          <br><br>
          <b>The transition-duration:</b> transition duration property defines how long it takes for a property to
           go from one state to another.
          <b>The transition-delay</b> transition-delay property defines the time 
          it should take after the property changes before the second transition happens.
          <b> transition-property:</b> transition-property property defines which CSS properties the transition effect will affect.
          <b> transition-timing-function:</b> The transition-timing function, allows you to change the pace of a transition by choosing how fast or slow to go. 
           You can slow down part of a transition and speed up other parts. You can even hold each part of the transition
            for a specific length of time before it transitions to the next state.
          <br><br>
          <b>Animations:</b> CSS only changes elements gradually. With CSS transitions, you can change the style of
           an element by setting rules for how it changes from one state to another. But with CSS animations, you 
           can also tell the browser to change whatever properties you want over time so you can make more complex 
           interactions than simple changes.
          <br><br>
          <b>Keyframes:</b> Keyframes are a way to define a series of steps in a CSS animation. 
          <br></br>
          <b>animation-name:</b> The animation-name property defines the name of the animation. You can create a name for an animation when you make the animation in CSS. 
          You can use this name of your animation instead of the name of your CSS or the @keyframes 
          keyword and the code to make it when you want to show it.
          <br><br>
          <b>animation-duration:</b> The animation-duration property defines the length of the animation.
          <br><br>
          <b>animation-timing function:</b> The animation-timing-function property defines how the animation will run.
          <br><br>
          <b>Html5 Canvas:</b> The HTML5 Canvas element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).
          <br><br>
          <b>SVG:</b> Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based language for describing vector graphics.
          <br><br>
          <b>Drag and drop:</b> The drag and drop feature allows you to drag and drop an element on another element.

            <!--Questions here-->
            <b>SVG:</b> As I was watching some youtube videos on this topic, 
            I was wondering if developers would mostly just use software such as Figma to create their SVG files.
