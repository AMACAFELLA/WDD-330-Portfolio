        <!-- Activities here-->
        <a href="team/index.html">Team activity</a> I was with my group and participated, but my internet was so slow that day I hardly heard anything, but I ended up doing the activity on my own to understand for myself.

        <h1>Notes:</h1>
        <p>
          <!-- Note here-->
          <b>Errors:</b> When a program runs, it may encounter a mistake and cannot continue. 
          The program will typically stop running, and the user will be presented with an error message. 
          Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program, and they are three types of errors.
          <br><br>
          <b>System error:</b> This occurs when the program encounters an error interacting with external devices
           or a program
          <br><br>
          <b>Programmer error:</b> This occurs when the programmer has incorrect syntax. This is usually a typo.
          <br><br>
          User error occurs when the user enters incorrect data, and the program doesn't recognize the data.
          <br></br>
          <b>Strict Mode:</b> JavaScript 5 added a way that makes it easy to see if you are using a poor coding 
          style. It also gives a warning (with an error message) when you use features that are no longer supported. 
          If your code is not in strict mode, the browser will run code that might cause errors, 
          but strict mode helps prevent that.
          <br><br>
          <b>Lint tools:</b> Linting tools can be used to check JavaScript code. 
          It can check if you have any errors in your JavaScript code, besides the ones that the strict mode would catch.
          <br><br>
          <b> Handling:</b> When a program stops working by itself, it conveys that something was wrong.
           The message says one of the program pieces had a problem and is not working anymore. 
           This is good when there are errors so we can fix them, and this happens when you have a lot of bugs 
           in a program.
          <br><br>
          If you put code inside a try block, it will go to the catch block if an error happens. 
          If you put code inside a finally block, it will still run whether an error occurred or not.
        </p>
        <h1>Questions:</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <!--Questions here-->
            Would you recommend we use frameworks to test our code? I use stylelint for the CSS when coding sass.
