        <h1>Notes:</h1>
        <p>
          <!-- Note here-->
          <b>Properties:</b> Properties and methods are built into the javascript language. 
          Properties are variables that are associated with objects. length property returns
          the number of values the fuction has. Custom properties can be added to functions and objects. 
          Example of a custom property: square.discription = "This is a square"; Cache property is a property that is used to cache data.
           Meaning that if the data is already in the cache, it will not be calculated again.
          <br><br>
          <b>Methods:</b> Methods are functions that does something with objects. Call method uses this to call the function. Apply methods works like call, but it takes an array as a parameter.
          <br><br>
          <b>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions:</b> IIFEs are functions that are immediately invoked as soon as it's defined. IIFEs are used to create private variables and functions within the scope.
          <br><br>
          <b>Temporary Variables:</b> Temporary variables are variables that are created within a function. Using Temporary variables in IIFEs will ensure that the variable is not accessible outside the function.
          <br></br>
          <b>initialization code:</b> An IIFE is created with the initialization code. This code is run before the function is called. Initialization code will only be run once.
          <br><br>
          <b>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves:</b> Is a function that can call, define and redefine itself. This is useful for creating reusable code. This is done using a fuction to a variable of the same name as the function.
          <br><br>
          <b>Recursive Functions:</b> Recursive functions are functions that invokes itself until certain steps are accomplished. This is useful for creating a function that has a finite number of steps.
          <br><br>
          <b>Closures:</b> Closures are functions that can access variables outside of the scope of the function. This is useful for creating functions that can access variables outside of the scope of the function.
          <br><br>
          <b>Pure Fuctions:</b> Pure functions are functions that do not change the state of the object. This is useful for creating functions that do not change the state of the object.
          <br><br>
          <b>Higher-Order funcions</b> Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as parameters. This is useful for creating functions that can take other functions as parameters.
          <br><br>
          <b>Ajax:</b> Ajax is a technology that allows you to send and receive data from a server. This is useful for creating functions that can send and receive data from a server.
          <br><br>
          <b>Fetch API:</b> Fetch API requests and sends data asyncronously in a network. This is useful for creating functions that can send and receive data asyncronously. Fetch API uses promises to handle asynchronous data.
        </p>
        <h1>Questions:</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <!--Questions here-->
            <b>Promises:</b> Why don't we just use an if statement instead of promises? To me this seems like it could achieve the same thing.
