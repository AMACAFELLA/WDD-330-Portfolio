        <p>
          Week 3's reading was excellent. I learned a few new things about javascript selectors,
           arrays, methods and the DOM. Even though this is a review for me, 
           I tried out activities to get myself used to it again.<br/><br/> 
           Notes one selectors: querySelector only returns the first element within the Dom.
           This is useful when looking for elements in the DOM. 
           Methods are pretty helpful and a shortcut to reduce code.
           Understand we will use many methods in the class exercises,
           and most examples and exercises have used them.
           A fun insight I enjoyed about the DOM was that I could alter the 
           content all in the javascript. It was a bit unorthodox,
           but it was fun messing around, changing styles, and deleting things.
