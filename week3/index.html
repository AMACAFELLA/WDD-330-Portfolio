        <h1>Notes:</h1>
        <p>
          Week 3's reading was excellent. I learned a few new things about javascript selectors,
           arrays, methods and the DOM. Even though this is a review for me, 
           I tried out activities to get myself used to it again.<br/><br/> 
           <span>Notes one selectors:</span> querySelector only returns the first element within the Dom.
           This is useful when looking for elements in the DOM. 
           Methods are pretty helpful and a shortcut to reduce code.
           Understand we will use many methods in the class exercises,
           and most examples and exercises have used them.
           A fun insight I enjoyed about the DOM was that I could alter the 
           content all in the javascript. It was a bit unorthodox,
           but it was fun messing around, changing styles, and deleting things.

           <span>Notes 2:</span>  There are several examples of events, including onload and onclick. 
           The abbreviation DOM stands for document object model, and it refers to the different objects,
            or tags, in an HTML file that a script can alter.
            <br><br>
            When you click a button on a web page, that event can trigger code that you've written (the function) to execute.
            The browser reads the HTML of that page and executes specific functions depending on what tag was clicked. 
            That tag is part of the document object model, so it will be found in the HTML of the web page.
            <br><br> 
            The DOM is a tree structure, and each node in the tree has a parent and children. The parent is the node 
            that contains the child. The child is the node that is contained by the parent. The root node is the 
            node that is not contained by any other node. The root node is the top of the tree.
