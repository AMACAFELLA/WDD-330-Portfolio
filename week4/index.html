    <h2>Week04</h2>

        <!-- Activities here-->
        <a href="team04.html">Team activity</a> I was with my group and participated, but my internet was so slow that day I hardly heard anything, but I ended up doing the activity on my own to understand for myself.

          <!-- Note here-->
          Forms: They are suitable for data entry. They can be assessed in various ways using the dom selectors. Using the value property to change or sort input is quite helpful.<br></br> Mixins: I love the idea of mixins and how we can mix different elements in one function and call it in another. It would be beneficial for designing and cutting out code when you need to reuse it. I think this might be the most helpful way to have dry code. The nice thing about mixins is that they can be used in styling CSS and for using variables and stopping the repeating process. This eliminates that for me. Also, when working in teams, this can be handy for others to look at your code and use it.

          Npm manager is quite useful in my other class. I have to use bootstrap. I had to download it using the npm manager, a simple command that makes it easy to use the in-app terminal to download libraries.

            Sir, you mentioned we added a touchend listener for the team activity, but in your solution, no touchend was seen, only click event listener. 
            I'm somewhat confused about that. Were we not supposed to add a touchend?
