        <!-- Activities here-->
        <a href="team04.html">Team activity</a> I was with my group and participated, but my internet was so slow that day I hardly heard anything, but I ended up doing the activity on my own to understand for myself.

        <h1>Notes:</h1>
        <p>
          <!-- Note here-->
          <b>OOP:</b> Object-oriented programming is a method of coding that enables you to organize 
          code according to the objects it works with. Object-oriented programming organizes code by grouping 
          related functions and data into a single entity called an object. Each object has unique attributes 
          and behaviors.
          <br><br>
          <b>Inheritance:</b> Child classes can inherit from parent classes, which saves on coding.
          <br><br>
          <span>Polymorphism:</span> If a child object has the same features as a parent object or an object
           it takes attributes from, then the child object doesnâ€™t need to redundantly code the same features.
          <br><br>
          <b>Forms:</b> They are suitable for data entry. They can be assessed in various ways using the 
          dom selectors. Using the value property to change or sort input is quite helpful.
          <br></br> 
          <b>Mixins:</b> I love the idea of mixins and how we can mix different elements in one function 
          and call it in another. It would be beneficial for designing and cutting out code when you need to reuse it.
          I think this might be the most helpful way to have dry code.
          <br></br>
          The nice thing about mixins is that they can be used in styling CSS and for using variables 
          and stopping the repeating process. This eliminates that for me. Also, when working in teams, 
          this can be handy for others to look at your code and use it.
          <br></br>
          <b>NPM:</b> Npm manager is quite useful in my other class. I have to use bootstrap. 
          I had to download it using the npm manager, a simple command that makes it easy to use the in-app
          terminal to download libraries.

          <h1>Questions:</h1>
          <li>
            <!--Questions here-->
            Sir, you mentioned we added a touchend listener for the team activity, but in your solution, no touchend was seen, only click event listener. 
            I'm somewhat confused about that. Were we not supposed to add a touchend?
