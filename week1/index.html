        <a href="/week1/story.html">Week 1 notes/exercises</a> - Revision on coding again for me. Learned about local storage and how to use it.
        It reminds me of shared preferences in Android. It has a lot of similarities to how I used to store data in Android.
        When the user saves a story, it saves it to local storage. When the user loads a story, it loads it from local storage.
        When the user displays a story, it displays it in the story display section.  
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
